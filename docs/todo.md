## Todo next

- ability to 'lock' into one stock for a nominal $100 and track that price
- ability to 'unlock' the pick

```
{
  userId: "foobar",
  ticker: "AAPL",
  shares: 0.5857,
  buyPrice: 170.73,
  buyTimestamp: 24 February 2024 at 20:52:35 UTC
  lastFetchedPrice: 173.24,
  lastFetchedTimestamp: 25 February 2024 at 20:52:35 UTC
}
```

`Number of shares = Investment amount / Share price.`

`e.g. share calculation: $100 / price ($170.73) = 0.5857`
